## What is Skip?

Skip is a free, open-source tool for building native iOS and Android apps from a single Swift codebase. You write your app in Swift and SwiftUI, and Skip produces real Jetpack Compose for Android. Both sides are genuinely native: SwiftUI on iOS, Jetpack Compose on Android. No web views, no custom rendering engine, and no additional runtime.

Skip supports two development modes:

- **Skip Fuse** compiles your Swift natively for Android using the [official Swift SDK for Android](https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-6.3-released/#android). You get the full Swift language, standard library, and Foundation on both platforms, with bridging to call Kotlin and Java APIs when needed.

- **Skip Lite** transpiles your Swift source code to Kotlin, maximizing interoperability with existing Kotlin and Java libraries and the Android ecosystem.

Both modes map SwiftUI to Jetpack Compose using the [SkipUI](https://github.com/skiptools/skip-ui) compatibility framework, so your UI is native on each platform.

### Why Skip?

- **No new language to learn.** If you know Swift and SwiftUI, you already know how to build for Android with Skip. Other cross-platform tools ask you to write JavaScript, Dart, or Kotlin. Skip lets you keep writing Swift.

- **Truly native on both platforms.** Skip produces real SwiftUI on iOS and real Jetpack Compose on Android. Users get the native look, feel, and performance they expect.

- **Full ecosystem access.** Skip apps can use Swift packages on both platforms, and can call Kotlin/Java APIs directly on Android. Over 2,200 Swift packages already build for Android, as tracked at the [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com/search?query=platform%3Aandroid).

- **No lock-in.** Skip builds on the officially supported Swift SDK for Android. Your Swift code, packages, and skills work on Android with or without Skip.

- **Free and open source.** Skip is complete free and developed independently from any parent corporation, funded by [your sponsorship](https://skip.dev/sponsor/).

### Skip versus {Flutter/React Native/Compose Multiplatform/MAUI/etc.}

Choosing a technology to help you build an app for iOS and Android from a single codebase can be a make-or-break decision. Everyone knows a bad app or a crummy port within moments of launching the app, and consumers are ruthless in deleting bloated, slow, or "weird-feeling" apps within moments.

You can read our own assessment of Skip's strengths at [skip.dev/compare/](https://skip.dev/compare/).

## Quick Start

Install Skip with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), verify your environment, and create your first project:

```shell
brew tap skiptools/skip
brew install skip
skip checkup
skip create
```

Your project will be created and opened in Xcode. Run it against an iPhone simulator, and Skip will automatically build and launch the Android version on a running emulator at the same time.

For the full setup guide, see [Getting Started](https://skip.dev/docs/gettingstarted/).

### Native Android Compilation (Skip Fuse)

To build apps that compile Swift natively for Android, install the Swift Android SDK:

```shell
skip android sdk install
```

Then create a native app project:

```shell
skip init --native-app --appid=com.example.myapp my-app MyApp
```

See the [Fuse mode documentation](https://skip.dev/docs/modes/) for details on how native compilation and Kotlin bridging work.

## Sample Apps

Skip ships with several sample applications that demonstrate different features and patterns. All are open source and available in the [skiptools](https://github.com/skiptools) organization.

### Skip Showcase

A comprehensive catalog of SwiftUI components running side by side on iOS and Android. The best way to see how Skip maps SwiftUI to Jetpack Compose.

## Architecture

The [skip](https://github.com/skiptools/skip) repository hosts the Skip SwiftPM build plugin, which integrates with Xcode and Swift Package Manager to drive the Android build alongside your normal iOS build. It works together with [skipstone](https://github.com/skiptools/skipstone), the binary that powers both the `skip` CLI and the plugin.

On this branch, `skip web` generates the browser host files used by the experimental `SkipWebWasm`
product. It provides the web entry-point contract and DOM runtime foundation; SwiftUI-to-DOM
translation and a production Wasm SDK integration remain follow-up work.
